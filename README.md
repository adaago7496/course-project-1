# course-project-1
This is my course project, it is a simplified version of a pizza restaurant. With more time the visual aspects of the website will be improved with a color theme that will help to intice the user to order more pizza, and to have the colors flow into eachother. 

I want to create a look and feel of a pizza restaurant that is a fun and comfortable feeling. This will be accomplished by adding images of the local customers eating at the restaurant and by showing images and posts related to community outreach.

The build is not fully complete due to time limitations, there are additional features that will be added, such as, a customizable pizza and more animations when creating an order.
